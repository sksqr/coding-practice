Question to ask:
1. Can we mutate the array while processing.
2. Approach it from front index 0 if its not working then try to approach it from last index n-1
4. Sorting the array can solve the problem but the time complexity will be O(nlogn).
3. Try with leftPrefixSum, leftPrefixMax, leftPrefixMin, rightPrefixSum, rightPrefixMax, rightPrefixMin,
4. Kaden's Algorithm
